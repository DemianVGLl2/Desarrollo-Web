                    Officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital and most populous city of Japan.<br> 
                    Formerly known as Edo, its metropolitan area (including neighboring prefectures, 13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 
                    square miles) is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018;
                    although this number has been gradually<br> decreasing since then, the prefecture itself has a population of 14.09 
                    million people while the city's central 23 special <br>wards have a population of 9.73 million.<br> Located at the head of

                    <br>Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and is the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.

                    noisy arcades, busy pedestrian crossings, quirky youth fashions, and many many incredibly delicious restaurants.<br> 
                    If all you do in Tokyo is eat, you’ll have an amazing time—even as vegetarians we ate so well.<br> 
                    Tokyo is also home to some of the weirdest activities we’ve ever done. <br>From themed cafes (cats, owls, maids, 
                    robots, goats—you name it, Tokyo has it) to sensory-overload shows and arcades to cos-play go-karting.<br>
                    On my first trip to Tokyo I was overwhelmed by the sprawling city and couldn’t help comparing it unfavourably
                    to Kyoto.<br> On repeat visits I’ve grown to love the city (the food certainly helped) and while it isn’t as 
                    attractive as Kyoto, there is so much to do that you won’t want to skip it.</em>

                    If you are looking to get outside and enjoy some nature, this is the best place to visit in Vancouver.<br> A paved seawall path encircles 
                    the green space and is a wonderful place to explore on foot or by bicycle.<br> Inland, the park offers many things to do,
                     and you can spend a full day exploring attractions like the totem poles at Brockton Point or the Vancouver Aquarium. <br>
                     Spectacular views are a standard throughout the park either back towards the city or out to the ocean. Come spring, the 
                     park's gardens and shrubs burst into a rainbow of beautiful colors, led by the cherry trees and closely followed by the 
                     rhododendrons.<br> In the summer, an outdoor pool operates right at the edge of the ocean. This 80-meter pool is heated and 
                     is a popular spot for families because of its gently sloped entry.</em>
